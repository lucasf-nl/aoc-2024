- [ ] V
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] F#
- [ ] Clojure
- [ ] Elixir
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Perl
- [x] Risc-V Assembly
- [x] COBOL
- [ ] Objective-C
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Brainfuck
- [ ] Erlang

## Day 1: Historian Hysteria

This AoC started off with COBOL, not great, but better than some of the other options
on the list. As I'm programming on a Mac I chose GnuCOBOL which is available in Homebrew.
The GnuCOBOL Programmer's Guide written by Gary L. Cutler and Vincent B. Coen provided all
the COBOL knowledge needed to write day 1. Writing day 1 took about 3 hours.

## Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

Rust, a sane language. I already have a lot of experience writing in Rust so this day
would be easy, *he said, not knowing what awaited him*. This was pretty easy, but
part 2 required some renovations.

## Day 3: ????

RISC-V Assembly
