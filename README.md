# Advent Of Code 2024, masochism edition

I have decided that for every puzzle the wheel will decide what language my solution
will be written in. The possible list of languages is: 

- D
- Common lisp
- C3
- Ruby
- Scratch
- PHP
- Shell/Bash
- ocaml
- Pascal
- Fortran
- Zig
- Swift
- Uiua
- Rust
- Ada
- Go
- V
- Kotlin
- F#
- Clojure
- Elixir
- Javascript
- Perl
- Risc-V Assembly
- COBOL
- Objective-C
- Haskell
- Brainfuck
- Erlang

## Day 1: Historian Hysteria

This AoC started off with COBOL, not great, but better than some of the other options
on the list. As I'm programming on a Mac I had to install the `gnu-cobol` package
through Homebrew (which I probably still have to remove).
